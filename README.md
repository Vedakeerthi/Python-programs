# **Alice, bob :**

A simple hackerrank problem where two arrays have their elements and both the arrays are compared if the first array element is greater than that of the second array element then alice gets a point else bob gets a point, this is the description about the program.
<br/>

# **Fizz buzz :**

Another hackerrank problem, where a certain integer is taken as input, then it is passed to the fizzbuzz function. A for loop upto that integer is made to run and in between the range if a number is divisible by 3 it prints 'Fizz' else if it is divisible by 5 it prints 'Buzz' or if it is divisible by both 3 and 5, it prints as 'Fizzbuzz'.

# **Alphabets :**

A simple creative program where a number is taken as input and added with 64 to display the number's specified alphabet for example if the number is 1 then it returns A, since we add it with 64 which is the ASCII values of alphabets, if the number is between 64 to 91, it prints the required alphabet else it prints as an invalid number. The alphabet is converted using a integer using the chr inbuilt function.

# **Number to words :**

A beginner level program which is to convert the given number in terms of name, for example if 100, it should return one hundred. This program is implemented in two ways, one is by using the num2words module and the other by using user defined function. The module takes the input and return the words, whereas the function takes the integer and takes the name digit by digit, and return their names from the list specified. But the disadvantage is that it can only be done upto thousand digit, and not above that.

# **Detecting vowels :**

A simple basic level program where a sentence is given as input and the number of vowels and the vowels are printed as output, the string is examined through a for loop if the word matches any of the vowel words then it is appended to an other list, which is then printed as output.
<br/>

# **Numpy operations :**

This numpy operations python file consists of a new module named numpy, which is used to mathematical operations and array related operations. The module is imported using the import statement, then an array is created and stored in a variable. This array is of one dimensional array, and then the basic operations on this array is performed, such as addition, subtration, multiplication, division and etc. Then a two dimensional array is declared and initialized in the variable b and the transpose of the array is printed. And thus some basic operations on an array is done.
<br/>

# **Two D array manipulation :**

A simple array operation program which is very helpful and handy, but the array is of 2D array. Here the array is created using the arange function where upto the declared value the array is created, and it is reshaped as 6x6 matrix. Once this is done the 4th and the 5th row of the matrix is extracted from the array. Next to that, an another 2d array is declared and stored in a variable, then the sum of the columns of the array is done using the sum function declaring that axis=0, which means it takes the columns not the rows.
