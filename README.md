# **Alice, bob :**

A simple hackerrank problem where two arrays have their elements and both the arrays are compared if the first array element is greater than that of the second array element then alice gets a point else bob gets a point, this is the description about the program.

# **Fizz buzz :**

Another hackerrank problem, where a certain integer is taken as input, then it is passed to the fizzbuzz function. A for loop upto that integer is made to run and in between the range if a number is divisible by 3 it prints 'Fizz' else if it is divisible by 5 it prints 'Buzz' or if it is divisible by both 3 and 5, it prints as 'Fizzbuzz'.
