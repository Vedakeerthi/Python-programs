# **Alice, bob :**

A simple hackerrank problem where two arrays have their elements and both the arrays are compared if the first array element is greater than that of the second array element then alice gets a point else bob gets a point, this is the description about the program.

# **Fizz buzz :**

Another hackerrank problem, where a certain integer is taken as input, then it is passed to the fizzbuzz function. A for loop upto that integer is made to run and in between the range if a number is divisible by 3 it prints 'Fizz' else if it is divisible by 5 it prints 'Buzz' or if it is divisible by both 3 and 5, it prints as 'Fizzbuzz'.
<br/>

# **Alphabets :**

A simple creative program where a number is taken as input and added with 64 to display the number's specified alphabet for example if the number is 1 then it returns A, since we add it with 64 which is the ASCII values of alphabets, if the number is between 64 to 91, it prints the required alphabet else it prints as an invalid number. The alphabet is converted using a integer using the chr inbuilt function.
